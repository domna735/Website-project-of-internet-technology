                <h3 align="center">ChatGPT </h3>
                <p>Have you ever heard of ChatGPT? Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that enables machines to simulate human intelligent behaviours to perform specific tasks. This technology is not new to our ears, but it has developed rapidly and has eventually become the trend in this era. In December 2015, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, et al. established OpenAI to improve AI technology and its development. ChatGPT is one of the OpenAI projects. It is an artificial intelligence chatbot built on OpenAI's foundational large language models (LLMs).</p>

                <p>GPT-1 has a limited impact on tasks that have yet to be fine-tuned. Therefore, it was not considered to be a conversational AI. However, in June 2020, the invention of GPT-3 made a significant result in AI history. There are intimate relationships between GPT-3 and ChatGPT. It allows users to interact with it directly. This move has dramatically increased the popularity of artificial intelligence. This research will explore four aspects, namely operation, characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of ChatGPT.</p>

        <br>       
        <p>In layperson's terms, the operation of ChatGPT depends on learning, which is similar to the thought function in the human brain. ChatGPT learns from human demonstrations to adapt to various contexts with known, desired behaviour utilizing reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Before its research preview, ChatGPT was trained on a significant amount of data, and it continues to learn from the human knowledge users provide, allowing it to provide accurate human-like responses on various topics. Using the data it was trained on, ChatGPT tries to understand the sentences that the users input before spewing back a string of words it thinks would best address it, and it all happens in the actual chatting procedure. Training is a significant part of building a well-functional AI like ChatGPT. The training method includes developing AI-specific guidelines before subjecting them to scenarios or providing a ton of data to digest to create algorithms. The language models of GPT-3 were trained on around 500 billion "tokens". The official OpenAI platform explains that the GPT model family uses "tokens," frequently occurring character sequences, to read text. A single "token" typically represents around four characters for regular English text. Therefore, 500 billion "tokens" would be equal to approximately 375 billion words. Although there are some rumors that more parameters do not mean better, massive training achieved the success of ChatGPT. The ways to strengthen ChatGPTâ€™s ability to understand are as follows:

                        Briefly, ChatGPT training by many cutting-edge technologies makes it fully understand the prompts, predict, and give reasonable feedback.</p>
                <p>Due to the technology of GPT, the characteristics of ChatGPT are outstanding. ChatGPT is different from the traditional AI text generation that can only identify prompts and give a predetermined reply because of the outdated, regular pattern and lacks a changing database. Not only can ChatGPT answer the users fluently but can also remember the previous chat. The performance is more humane and clearly understands what will happen after 2021. It is the most communicative AI so far and can process the user's natural language more humanely. Besides being a chatbot, ChatGPT can also be used to complete many other jobs.

                Another characteristic of ChatGPT is self-improvement. Users can click the like or dislike button to rate the reply. Then, ChatGPT will acquire the necessary logic and adapt to the given scenario to optimize its language generation algorithm.</p>
                <p>One of the advantages of ChatGPT is convenience. There are no complicated or expensive setups. In contrast, it provides straightforward sign-up and free chat. The main reason why ChatGPT can spread so fast is by adopting low technology threshold. ChatGPT also has its self-censorship function to avoid providing malicious or targeted replies. Despite there being occasional omissions, this overall reduces the possibility of malicious use of ChatGPT for illegal purposes as well as the risk and social defense costs of this revolutionary technology. Moreover, the human-like reply is also one of its advantages. Users can present a command or prompt like normal daily chat, which is similar to Siri of Apple or other virtual assistants. Furthermore, ChatGPT can competently respond to inquiries on almost any topic and discern clients' motivations. While users may have blur recognition of the answer they seek, ChatGPT can still guess and give results based on their description. Thanks to its robust response and understanding ability, there are lots of applications of ChatGPT. Characteristics of customer service by using ChatGPT in the e-business field:
                <OL>
                    <LI>24-hour service</LI>
                    <LI>Instant reply</LI>
                    <LI>Relatively low cost</LI>
                    <LI>Understanding the usersâ€™ needs</LI>
                    <LI>Working fluently over a long period</LI>
                </OL>
        <table BORDER="1">
        <tr>
        <td><img src="images\ecommerce-gd434c441e_1280.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" ></td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><h4><b>Fig. 4.</b> ChatGPT is used as customer service by merchants in the e-business field.</h4></td></tr>
        </table>
        <br>    
                <p>Additionally, ChatGPT can gather pertinent data and client input to make problems easier to resolve. Some marketing research shows that business operating efficiency may benefit from ChatGPT's human-like connection by feeling heard. ChatGPT also reduces the cost-effectiveness of research because it offers correct information about a user's chosen subject and may identify the material's author. Researchers do not need to pay extra time for the requirement for more investigation on a specific topic.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, ChatGPT is not flawless. Although ChatGPT can reduce research time costs on a given topic as aforementioned, it has issues regarding the research:
                <UL>
                    <LI>unsatisfactory performance in the face of the authenticity and accuracy of the research;</LI>
                    <LI>offering fake author names and outdated URLs or DOIs, and some non-existing articles, even though the generated references look reasonable and trustworthy; and</LI>
                    <LI>failing to provide the article resource on websites of authoritative academic institutions.</LI>
                </UL>
        <table BORDER="1">
        <tr>
        <td><img src="images\laptop-g63e49c370_1280.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" ></td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td><h4><b>Fig. 5.</b> There are some issues regarding ChatGPT.</h4></td></tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <p>This shows that ChatGPT might fail to identify the authenticity of the data correctly. Furthermore, it is undeniable that ChatGPT sometimes wrongly understands the tone and content of the users' speech, despite having an excellent natural language understanding ability. And for more subtle emotions, ChatGPT is not different from other chatbots, so it cannot cope with emotional support in customer service. Likewise, ChatGPT's self-censorship feature is not immaculate. There are several cases where it will fall to user deception and provide improper responses and prejudiced remarks. This phenomenon will undoubtedly have an immeasurable impact on users as ChatGPT has no age limit. Similarly, AI-based apps can be used maliciously by skilled cybercriminals. Although the creative creation of ChatGPT seems to be its product, it still relies on human speech or text. If users use it unrestrainedly, it will cause trouble. For example, users may infringe the copyright of the actual creator by using ChatGPT. This effect, in disguise, has hit the creative market's return rate and creators' confidence.</p>
        <p>To conclude, ChatGPT is an epoch-making technological product that has apparent changes to the whole world. It has been updated and iterated until it is what it is today while progressing non-stop. It brings more convenience to human beings and reduces various costs. However, it also poses hidden dangers, such as cracking down on artistic creation and increasing the possibility of disseminating harmful materials. With the rapid development of technology, it is believed that the side effects of this newly developed ChatGPT will be solved, and it will continuously impact on human everyday life.</p>
